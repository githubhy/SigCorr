## Definitions

::: {#def-group}
### Group
A set $G$, one operators $\cdot$ form $(G,\cdot)$ such that

- *Associativity*: $\forall a,b,c \in A$
    $$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$
- *Identity element*: $\forall a \in A, \exists ! e \in A$
    $$e \cdot a = a \cdot e$$
- *Inverse element*: $\forall a \in A, \exists ! b \in A$
    $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$$
::: {.callout-note}
$\exists !$ is the [uniqueness existential quantification](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification).
:::
:::


::: {#def-group-order}
### Group order
The **order**of a finite group is the number of its elements.

The *order* of group G is denoted by $ord(G)$ or $|G|$.
:::


::: {#def-group-element-order}
### Element order (Period, or Period length)
The *order* (or **period length** or **period**) of an element of a finite group $G$ is the *order* of the subgroup generated by the element.

$\forall a \in G$, the generated group (strictly speaking, subgroup) is denoted by $\langle a \rangle$.

If $a \in G$ and the generated group is $($\langle a \rangle$,\cdot)$,
$$\langle a \rangle = \{a^k:k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

The *order* of element $a$ is denoted by $ord(a)$ or $|a|$ for symplicity. It is actually
$$ord(a) = ord(\langle a \rangle)$$


$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, a \in G$ and the identity $e$,
$$a^n = e \iff ord(a) \mid n$$
:::


::: {#thm-lagrange}
For any finite group $G$, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of $G$ divides the order of $G$.

Formally, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$,
$$ |G| = [G:H]\cdot|H|$$
where $[G:H]$ is the [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_a_subgroup).
:::


::: {#thm-fermat-little}
### Fermat's Little Theorem
If $p$ is a prime number, $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}$
$$x^p \equiv x \pmod p$$
or equivalently
$$x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$$
:::
::: {.proof}
Assuming $p$ is a prime number, the set $G = \{1,2,\dots,p-1\}$ forms a finite group (@def-group) w.r.t $\cdot \pmod p$. And $ord(G) = p - 1$.

Take $a \in G$, and let $k = ord(a)$, then $(G' = \{1,a,a^2,\dots,a^{k-1}\}, \cdot \pmod p)$ is a subgroup of G. And $ord(G) = ord(a) = k$.

By Lagrange's theorem (@thm-lagrange), $k \mid ord(G)$ or $k \mid (p - 1)$. So $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}_\neq 0, p - 1 = km$
$$
a^{p-1} = a^{km} \mathop{=}^{\text{Associativity}} (a^k)^m \mathop{=}^{G'} 1^m = 1
$$

Fore more details, such as to prove that every element of $G$ is invertible, see [proofs using group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_of_Fermat%27s_little_theorem#Proofs_using_group_theory)
:::


::: {#def-euler-totient-func}
### Euler's totient function
Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. It is written as as $\varphi(n)$.

- The number of integers k in the range $1 ≤ k ≤ n$ for which the greatest common divisor $\text{gcd}(n,k)$ is equal to 1.

::: {#def-abelian-group}
### Abelian group (Commutative group)
A set $A$, one operators $\cdot$ form $(A,\cdot)$ such that

- *Associativity*: $\forall a,b,c \in A$
    $$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$
- *Identity element*: $\forall a \in A, \exists e \in A$
    $$e \cdot a = a \cdot e$$
- *Inverse element*: $\forall a \in A, \exists b \in A$
    $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$$
- *Commutativity*: $\forall a,b \in A$
    $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$$
:::


::: {#def-ring}
### Ring
Rings are algebraic structures that generalize fields such that

- Multiplication needs *not* to be *commutative*
- *Multiplicative inverses* need *not* exist.

Formally, a set $R$, two operators addtion $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$ forms $(R,+,\cdot)$ such that

- R is an *Abelian group* (@def-abelian-group) w.r.t $+$.
- *Associativity*: $\forall a,b,c \in R$
    $$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$
- *Distributivity*: $\forall $a,b,c \in R$
    $$a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c), and (a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$$
:::{.callout-note}
Note that the operator $\cdot$ in @def-abelian-group and @def-ring are not relevant.
:::
:::


::: {#def-ring-char}
### Ring Characteristic
Two versions:

1. The smallest number of times one must use ring $R$'s multiplicative identity (1) in a sum to get the additive identity (0), that is
    $$char(R) = \mathop{\arg min}_n\{\underbrace{1+\cdots +1}_n = 0\}$$
    if $n$ do not exists, $n = 0$.
2. The smallest number of the exponent of ring $R$'s addictive group, that is, $\forall a \in G$,
    $$char(R) = \mathop{\arg min}_n\{\underbrace{a+\cdots +a}_n = 0\}$$
:::


::: {#def-field}
### Field
A field consists of

- A *Ring* (@def-ring) $(F,+,\cdot)$
- $F^\times = \{a \in F \mid a \neq 0\}$ forms an Abelian group w.r.t multiplication $\cdot$ : $(F^\times,\cdot)$
:::

More specificly, $\forall a,b,c \in F$, the following [**field axioms**]{#def-field-axim} holds

- *Associativity* of *addition* and *multiplication*: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$, and $a ⋅ (b ⋅ c) = (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c$.
- *Commutativity* of *addition* and *multiplication*: $a + b = b + a$, and $a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a$.
- *Additive* and *multiplicative* *identity*: there exist two different elements $0$ and $1$ in $F$ such that $a + 0 = a$ and $a ⋅ 1 = a$.
- *Additive* *inverses*: for every $a$ in $F$, there exists an element in F, denoted $−a$, called the additive inverse of $a$, such that $a + (−a) = 0$.
- *Multiplicative* **inverses**: for every $a ≠ 0$ in $F$, there exists an element in $F$, denoted by $a^{−1}$ or $\frac{1}{a}$, called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that $a ⋅ a^{−1} = 1$.
- *Distributivity* of multiplication over addition: $a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c)$.


::: {#def-finite-field}
### Finite Field (Galois Field)
A finite set that the operators $\cdot,+,-,/$ satisfy the [field axims](#def-field-axim).
:::

The [**order** or **size**]{#def-field-order} of a finite field is the number of its elements.


::: {#thm-finite-field-order}
### Finite Field Order (Size)
A finite field of *order* $q$ exists $\iff q=p^n$, where $p$ is a prime number, $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$.

The field is denoted by $\mathbb{F}_q$ or $GF(q)$.


:::


::: {#thm-finite-field-char}
### Finite Field Characteristic
For a field of *order* $q = p^n$, the *characteristic* (@def-ring-char) is $p$, where $p$ is a prime number, $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$
:::


::: {#def-cyclic-group}
### Cyclic group (Monogenous group)
a cyclic group or **monogenous group** is a group that is generated by a single element. That is

- It is a set of *invertible* elements with a single associative binary operation, and it contains an element $g$ such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to $g$ or its inverse.
- Each element can be written as a power of $g$ in *multiplicative* notation, or as a multiple of $g$ in *additive* notation.
- This element $g$ is called a *generator* of the group.
:::

::: {#exm-cyclic-group-mod-add}
#### Integer and modular addition
For every positive integer $n$, the set of *integers modulo $n$*, again with the operation of *addition*, forms a finite cyclic group, denoted $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.

- A modular integer $i$ is a generator of this group if $i$ is relatively prime to $n$, because these elements can generate all other elements of the group through integer addition. The number of such generators is $\varphi(n)$, where $\varphi$ is the *Euler totient function* (@def-euler-totient-func).
- Every finite cyclic group $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, where $n = |G|$ is the *order* (@def-group-order) of the group.
:::


::: {#def-multi-group-of-field}
### Multiplicative group of a field
The *multiplicative group* of a field $F$ is $F^\times = F - \{0\}$, under the multiplication operation with $\cdot$.

If $F$ is finite of order $|F| = q$, then $F^\times$ is cyclic, that is
$$F^\times \cong C_{q-1}$$
where $\cong$ means having the same remainder when divided by a specified integer, and $\forall g \in F$
$$C_{q-1} = \langle g \rangle = \{g^k \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\} \mathop{=}^{|F|=q} \{e, g, g^2, \dots , g^{q-1}\}$$
:::


::: {#def-congruence-modn}
### Congruence modulo n
Congruence modulo $n$ is a congruence relation, meaning that it is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the operations of $\textcolor{magenta}{\text{addition}}$, $\textcolor{magenta}{\text{subtraction}}$, and $\textcolor{magenta}{\text{multiplication}}$. Congruence modulo $n$ is denoted:
$$a\equiv b \pmod n$$
:::


::: {#def-multi-group-modn}
### Multiplicative group of integers modulo n
The integers coprime (relatively prime) to $n$ from the set $\{0,1,\dots ,n-1\}$ of $n$ non-negative integers form the group under multiplication modulo $n$

- It is denoted $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$
- The set of (*congruence* (@def-congruence-modn) classes of) integers modulo $n$ with the operations of addition and multiplication is a *ring* (@def-ring)([Quotient Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_ring#Examples)). 

The *multiplicative group of integers modulo $n$*, which is part of this ring, is denoted as $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$
:::


::: {#def-poly-order}
### Polynomial order
For a polynomial $f(x)$ over a field $F$, the period (or order) of $f(x)$ is the least positive integer $t$ such that $f(x) \mid (x^t — 1)$, denoted by $\text{per}(f) = t$.
:::





## Finite Field Properties
Let $F$ be a finite field and $|F| = q = p^n$, meaning $F=\mathbb{F}_q=\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $\textcolor{magenta}{p\text{ is a prime number}}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\neq 0}$.

$F^\times = F - \{0\}$

### The polynomial $x^q - x$

- has all $q$ elements of $F$.
- those $q$ elements are the roots of the polynomial.

### Multiplicative group
$F^\times$ is a *multiplicative group* (@def-multi-group-of-field).

- Its *generator* is $g$.
- It is *cyclic*.
- The *primitive element* is $g$, meaning
$$g^q = 1 \text{ but } g^m \neq 1, \forall m \in {1,2,\dots , q-1}$$
- $g$'s [minimal polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory)) is a [primitive polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_polynomial_(field_theory)).
- There will be several $g$ for $F^\times$

About the *minimal polynomial* of $F$, assuming $m_\alpha(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha \in F$,

- $m_\alpha(x)$ is unique for $\alpha$.
- $m_\alpha(x)$ is irreducible.
- $\forall f(x)$ over $F$, if $f(\alpha)=0$, then $m_\alpha(x) \mid f(x)$.
    + $m_\alpha(x) \mid (x^{p^n}-x)$
- $\text{deg}(m_\alpha(x)) \leq n$.
    + $m_g(x)$ being the minimal polynomial of $g$, $\text{deg}(m_g(x)) = n$.
- $m_{\alpha^p}(x) = m_\alpha(x)$.

::: {#def-minipoly-period}
#### Period of the minimal polynomials
According to the definition of *polynomial order* (@def-poly-order) and *element order* (@def-group-element-order)
$$\text{per}(m_\alpha) = \text{ord}(\alpha)$$

:::

### Characteristic
The least $i \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $i \cdot 1 = 0$ is the *characteristic* (@def-ring-char), and $i = p$

+ $(x+y)^p = x^p + y^p$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$
+ $\forall m \in \mathbb{N}_{\neq 1}, (x+y)^{p_m} = x^{p_m} + y^{p_m}$ in $F$, of which the *characteristic* is $p$

### Fermat's little theorem
(@thm-fermat-little), $\forall x \in F$

+ $x^q - x = 0$
+ the polynomial $X^q − X$ factors as
$$X^q-X=\prod_{a\in F}(X-a)$$

### Finite field extension

+ is [saparable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_polynomial#Separable_field_extensions) and simple.
+ if $E$ is a finite field and $F$ is a subfield of $E$, i.e., $F \subset E$, then $E$ is obtained from $F$ by adjoining a single element whose minimal polynomial is [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_polynomial).
    - every element of $E$ is a root of a non-zero polynomial with $\textcolor{orange}{\text{coefficients in }F}$.

::: {#exm-ext-finite-field}
#### Extension from $GF(p)$ to $GF(p^n)$
With an [irreducible polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial#Definition) $f(x)$ over $GF(p)$, and $\alpha \in \{\alpha \mid f(\alpha)=0\}$.
$$GF(p^n) = \{a_0 + a_1\alpha + a_2\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1} \mid \alpha_i \in GF(p)\}$$

$GF(p)$ is a subfield of $GF(p^n)$
$$GF(p) \subset GF(p^n)$$

Every element of $GF(p^n))$ has 2 equivalent representations:

- Exponential representation (also **Normal basis**): In terms of $GF(p^n) = \langle \alpha \rangle \cup \textcolor{magenta}{\{0\}}$
    $$\alpha^k, \forall k \in \{1,2,\dots,p^n-1,\textcolor{magenta}{\infty}\}$$
- Polynomial (Vector) representation (also **Polynomial basis**): In terms of the extension itself
    $$a_0 + a_1\alpha + a_2\alpha + \cdots + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}$$
- The polynomial representation is efficient for addition, whereas the exponential representation is good for multiplication. However, the exponential representation could be used efficiently with *Zech's logrithm* (@def-zech-logrithm).
:::

::: {#def-zech-logrithm}
#### Zech's logrithm
$\forall t,s \in \{0,1,\dots,p^n-1\}$, there exists a unique $\tau(t)$ called Zech's logrithm (or **trinomial table**) such that
$$1+\alpha^t=\alpha^\tau(t)$$
Addition:
$$\alpha^t+\alpha^s=\alpha^t(1+\alpha^{s-t})=\alpha^t\alpha^(\tau(s-t))$$
Multiplication:
$$\alpha^t\alpha^s=\alpha^{t+s}$$

The *trinomial table* is generated over $GF(p^n)$ defined by $\alpha^n+\alpha^m+1=0, 1 \leq m \leq n-1$

Good things about this method:
- Only needs to store the *trinomial table*.
:::

### Finite vector space

+ Any $m$ dimensional [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Definition_and_basic_properties) $V$ over $F$ has $q^m = p^{nm}$ elements.
+ $|V| = q = p^n$

### $F^\times$ is cyclic
$F^\times$ is a *cyclic group* (@def-cyclic-group)(@def-multi-group-of-field)
